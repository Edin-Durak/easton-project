                <p class="our-mission__description">The Easton Project is addressing urgent and persistent barriers in Quebec’s addiction and mental health system—especially those affecting English-speaking residents.</p>
                <p class="our-mission__description">From long wait times to financial constraints and a lack of transitional housing, the path to recovery is often obstructed. </p>
                <p class="our-mission__description">Our three-pronged model provides swift, compassionate, and practical support that helps individuals take action when they’re ready to seek help—and stay the course toward long-term healing. </p>
